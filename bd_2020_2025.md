In this video, I examine publicly available metrics documenting the state of Bangladesh from 2020 to 2025.

In contrast to idyllic narratives of "democracy", "transition", or "hope", I will only present publicly available facts that showcase a documented and pronounced deterioration over the last few years.

<#0.5#>

Metrics that define a stable nation, such as economic growth, homicide rates, communal safety, and judicial impartiality, have continued to worsen since the 2024 upheaval.

Let us begin with an outline of the economic trends since the year 2020.

At the time, even as the so-called pandemic paralyzed international commerce, Bangladesh maintained a resilient real GDP growth of approximately 3.5%, appearing among the most resilient economies in the world.

In fact, by 2021 and 2022, the nation was an economic outlier, surging with annual growth rates exceeding 6%, and motivating news stories of the upcoming Bengali economic tiger.

Here we have a baseline of a nation that, while possessing problems, displayed a clear and positive trajectory along these lines.


<#0.4#>

Yet, in the second half of 2024, this stability evaporated.

Following an extensive propaganda campaign and political upheaval funded by allegedly pro-Western bodies, Bangladesh saw a sharp drop in economic growth to 4.2% from 5.8% the previous year.

The economic contraction continues to worsen, with growth cratering to barely 3 percent at the end of 2025.

Some may point out at this stage that the Gross National Product was buoyed by nearly 33 billion US dollars in 2025, but this is a statistical mirage.

The 22% surge over 2024 GNP figures is not the result of new productive capacity or industrial advancements.

<#0.4#>

It is merely the result of "patriotic" sentiments cultivated across the expansive Bangladeshi diaspora through curated news stories and ongoing financial policy tweaks, including cash incentives for sending remittances and the forceful consolidation of informal "hundi" lending networks into formal banking channels.

Remittances are an external lifeline, and do not indicate domestic strength in any way. The $33 billion reflected in the foreign reserves serves only to mask a hollowed-out internal economy where millions of jobs were lost and inflation remains above 5% well into the end of the year.

The interim government has managed to secure $1.76 billion in IMF loan installments by implementing painful austerity measures, including fuel price hikes and interest rate increases, which disproportionately affect the poorer classes of Bengali society.

The administration has touted several anti-corruption efforts, replacing boards of 11 troubled banks and exposing $240 billion in illicit outflows, which has been lauded by international observers. But going over these arrests in detail indicates the same partisanship as the mass arrests. Furthermore, the fact that these administrative fixes have not translated into any meaningful impact towards the economy suggests the real impact of the supposedly increasing "domestic economic strength" is minimal to non-existent.

These measures have stabilized the currency, but have done so at the expense of the poor, who continue to grapple with 9% inflation and a stagnant job market.

This is not a mere transitory "slowdown" but a systemic and wide-ranging failure. High inflation, investor uncertainty, and persistent unrest have fundamentally broken the country's growth trajectory, irrespective of dialogues about "transition" or "change".

<#0.3#>

The reality is that the political upheaval has regressed economic growth by decades.

<#0.4#>

An economic deterioration might have been acceptable if other standards remained consistent, or improved, but this does not appear to be the case, despite statistical wizardry to hide this fact.

For instance, if one looks at the official crime statistics reported collectively, a 12% drop in recorded crime since 2024 would indicate a safer society, but this is manipulation with numbers.

This aggregate decline reflects reduced reporting of petty crimes, like theft and burglary, during the time of upheaval, meaning these crimes were comparatively less frequent, or less frequently reported, during the unfolding social chaos.

<#0.2#>

Crucially, when we isolate serious violent crime, however, the objective reality emerges. Homicides, which had been trending downward for years, jumped 36% in 2024 to 4,114 cases.

This spike can be directly attributed to the government's violent response to student-led protests, with death tolls ranging from 800 to over 1,000 citizens.

However, similar to other revolutions in history, the violence did not end with the regime change, but intensified. In the first half of 2025 alone, 1,933 murder cases were filed, surpassing all deaths directly attributed to state bodies the previous years. Over 179 vigilante mob lynchings were recorded in the first 11 months of the interim government. 








The police, demoralized and in fear, stood by as mobs dictated justice on the streets.

Monthly murder rates trended upward from January to June 2025, after which I could not find any statistics.

The violence has also expanded to Bengali citizens holding different beliefs, with 2,442 documented attacks on Hindu homes, temples, and even the vandalization of Sufi and Ahmadi Muslim shrines.

<#0.4#>

To maintain the appearance of order, the interim government launched "Operation Devil Hunt" in early 2025. While framed as a crackdown on crime, the empirical data revealed a clear partisan purge. By May 2025, over 48,000 people were detained, which is the largest mass arrest in the history of the nation, exceeding the worst purges of prior governments.

The vast majority were members or supporters of the ousted Awami League, highlighting the partisan nature of these events.

The new administration claimed it would end the "dark legacy" of extrajudicial killings, yet it has already overseen 27 extrajudicial killings in its first 11 months, seven more than the entirety of 2023, under the supposedly more "oppressive" regime.

Furthermore, the filing of sweeping cases against over 300,000 people, including journalists and activists, confirms that the judiciary remains a weapon of political persecution. The names on the warrants have changed, but the mechanism remains the same.

This is the "new dawn," same as the "old dawn," just a little worse each year.

<#0.4#>


The evidence for the past 300 years is in.

A people who believe they can vote themselves to prosperity will be eternally duped by verbally enticing soothsayers who talk of "policies" and "constitutions," of "pluralism" and "democracy," while those with power continue to plunder.

<#0.4#>

Consider, for instance, the July National Charter (JC) of 2025, which has been hailed as a beacon of progress.

This document contains over 80 proposed reforms, including a 10-year cap on prime ministerial tenure and the creation of a bicameral Parliament.

For those familiar with realpolitik, these "bold innovations" are linguistic and psychological placebos meant to temper the sentiments of a selectively educated mass who still believes that "voting" produces real meaningful change.

In practice, these policy changes provide little measurable benefit to the average citizen. The utopian future remains a scapegoat to avoid accountability for the present chaos.

<#0.4#>

Instead of discourse about the "bold innovations" promised by the July Charter, the 48,000 political arrests and spike in murders and violent crime are the real result of the upheaval. The record remittances are an externally provided crutch that does not reflect local economic output or ruler ccapacity.

The "transformative" rhetoric of the interim leadership is absolutely countered by the facts.

Bangladesh is poorer, slower, bloodier, and more divided than it was at the start of the decade.

<#0.3#>

There is one area of progress, however.

The circulation of social media, YouTube, and similar platforms has allowed propaganda to reach a wider base than the most totalitarian states could ever dream of in years prior.

Politicians know that feelings control masses, and emotions supersede facts. Decades of media refinement have allowed the construction of grand narratives about "heroes" and "villains" that can sway a population's sentiment within days if not hours.

<#0.3#>

All it takes is to keep the masses distracted with discourse about abstractions like "policies", or emotions like "resentment", all the while those with power continue to plunder as before.

Consider the constitutional identity shift from "Bangalee" to "Bangladeshi". On one hand, this sounds "nice" and "inclusive" to someone educated in a Western liberalist framework. It suggests the recognition of minority languages and cultures can be wrought through symbolic platitudes about "inclusion" and "pluralism".

<#0.3#>

But inclusion destroys identity, and pluralism degrades unity. Greatness has never been achieved by being "nice", but subservience loves compassion.

This is evidenced by the 2,442 attacks on the very groups these amendments were meant to protect.

<#0.3#>

The declaration of a "Bangladeshi" identity is perhaps the ultimate culmination of the colonial project, for to take on a label derived by non-Bengali foreigners is the voluntary subservience. 

The Bengali, or "Bangalee", race has a rich and extensive history predating the advent of the British and other foreign bodies and their cultures.

This was a people with its own kingdom, culture, language, and beliefs. Their borders, cities, treasures, and histories have been systematically demolished over centuries.






To instruct that same race to eradicate one of the last vestiges of its rich history, the organic Bengali identity derived over centuries, for a foreigner-established label formally acknowledging a colonial partition, will be the final nail in the coffin of the history of a people, sterilized with sentiments of "plurality" and "democracy".

A society of real, flesh-and-blood individuals with extensive cultures cannot be wiped out by changing words on a page. Future events will showcase this with increasing clarity.



<#0.3#>

The Bengali race will continue to quarrel and disintegrate as long as it bases its identities on propositional statements embodied in so-called "policies" and "constitutions".

The constitution of a people IS their race, their language, and their shared history. This is derived ORGANICALLY through centuries, which propositions should REPRESENT, not DEFINE.

The Bengali people must recognize its organic, nature-given identity as a unitary PEOPLE that precedes all propositions and labels. Otherwise, it will continue down this path of self-destruction, begun so long ago.
